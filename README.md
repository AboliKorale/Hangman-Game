# Hangman-Game

Hangman is a classic word-guessing game implemented in Python. The player tries to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters one at a time. Each incorrect guess reduces the number of remaining attempts, and the game ends when the player either guesses the word correctly or runs out of attempts.
